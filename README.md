# MSCS-634-B01-Lab4

## Purpose
This lab demonstrates regression modeling on the Diabetes dataset using linear, multiple, polynomial, Ridge, and Lasso regressions. We evaluate the impact of regularization and model complexity on performance and generalization.

## Key Insights
- Multiple regression provides more accurate predictions than single-variable regression.
- Polynomial regression can lead to overfitting if the degree is too high.
- Ridge and Lasso regularization help mitigate overfitting by penalizing complex models.
- Lasso regression performs feature selection by zeroing out less important features.

## Challenges
- Choosing appropriate alpha values for Ridge and Lasso.
- Balancing model complexity vs. performance during polynomial regression.
